# Python Programming Questions 

This session contains programming questions for python using image processing as an example. 

## Questions 1
Write a Python program that reads in an image file and displays it on the screen.

## Questions 2
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, converts it to grayscale, and saves the grayscale version as a new image file.

## Questions 3
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a Gaussian blur to it, and saves the blurred version as a new image file.

## Questions 4
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies an edge detection algorithm to it, and saves the edge-detected version as a new image file.

## Questions 5
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a thresholding algorithm to it, and saves the thresholded version as a new image file.

## Questions 6
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a rotation transformation to it, and saves the rotated version as a new image file.

## Questions 7
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a scaling transformation to it, and saves the scaled version as a new image file.

## Questions 8
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a perspective transformation to it, and saves the transformed version as a new image file.

## Questions 9
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a color space conversion to it, and saves the converted version as a new image file.

## Questions 10
Write a Python program that reads in an image file, applies a convolutional filter to it, and saves the filtered version as a new image file.
