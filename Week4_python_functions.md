# Python Functions 
Here is the basic syntax for defining a function in Python:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code to be executed
    return [expression]
```
	
where function_name is the name of the function, parameters are the input arguments to the function and return [expression] is an optional return statement that returns a value from the function.

## Example: Adding two numbers
Here is an example of a function that takes two parameters as input and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)
```
This code will output:

```python
7
```


## Example: Multiplying two numbers

Here is an example of a function that takes two parameters as input and returns their product:

```python
def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)
```
This code will output:

```python
12
```
