# Python Programming Questions 

This session contains programming questions for python using linear algebra as an example. 

## Questions 1: Vector Operations 
Design a program (using python class) that adds, subtracts and multiplies two vectors. The inputs are two vectors. This class should have at least 3 methods as follows
 - add(vector A, vector B)
 - subtract (vector A, vector B)
 - multiply (vector A, vector B) 

You can use python data structures such as list. You should not use libraries such as numpy. 

## Questions 2: Find a matrix transpose 
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and computes its transpose.

## Questions 3: Matrix Operations 
Design a program (using python class) that adds, subtracts and multiplies two matrices. The inputs are two matrices. This class should have at least 3 methods as follows
 - add(matrix A, matrix B)
 - subtract (matrix A, matrix B)
 - multiply (matrix A, matrix B)
 
## Questions 4: Find a matrix determinant 
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and computes its determinant.

## Questions 5: Find an inverse of matrix  
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and computes its inverse (if it exists).

## Questions 6: A square matrix
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and checks whether it is a square matrix.

## Questions 7: Check symmetric matrix
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and checks whether it is symmetric.

## Questions 8: Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and finds its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

## Questions 9: Find basis of vectors 
Write a Python function that takes a set of vectors as input and finds a basis for the subspace they span.

## Questions 10: Find SVD 
Write a Python function that takes a matrix as input and computes its singular value decomposition.
 
 
## Questions 11: Find popular words from a text file  
Write a Python program that takes a text file as input, reads its contents, and identifies the top 10 most frequently occurring words in the file. Your program should be able to handle large files efficiently.

## Questions 12: Hash table in python 
Design and implement a Hash Table in Python
