# PyTorch and Convolution 


## Part 1: PyTorch Getting Started  

Read about pytorch from 
- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt.html



Especially, watch youtube videos 
- Introduction to PyTorch
- Introduction to PyTorch Tensors

## Part 2: PyTorch Installation
Read about pytorch installation from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA
If you could not install, we are going to install it together (so do not have to spend time if is difficult)


## Part 3: Convolutional Neural Networks


Here's an image of a drag racer in action:
