# Python Variables

In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. Variables can be of different types, such as integer, float, and string.

## Integer Variables
An integer variable is a variable that stores an integer (whole number) value. The value can be positive or negative. 
For example:
```python
x = 5
y = -3 
```

# Python Float Type and Variables

A float, or floating point number, is a type of number in Python that contains a decimal point. These numbers are useful for mathematical calculations that require precision.

A float variable is a variable that stores a float value. The value can be positive or negative. Here is an example of a float variable:
```python
pi = 3.14159

print(pi)
# Output: 3.14159
```
