# Python Variables

In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. Variables can be of different types, such as integer, float, and string.

## Integer Variables
An integer variable is a variable that stores an integer (whole number) value. The value can be positive or negative. 
For example:
```python
x = 5
y = -3 
```

## Python Float Type Variable

A float, or floating point number, is a type of number in Python that contains a decimal point. These numbers are useful for mathematical calculations that require precision.

A float variable is a variable that stores a float value. The value can be positive or negative. Here is an example of a float variable:
```python
pi = 3.14159

print(pi)
# Output: 3.14159
```


## Python String Type Variable

A string, in Python, is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single or double quotes. It can be used to represent text or a sequence of characters.

A string variable is a variable that stores a string value. Here is an example of a string variable:
```python
name = "Alice"
print(name)
# Output: Alice 

last_name = "Smith"
full_name = name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
# Output: Alice Smith
```
You can also use different String methods such as .upper(), .lower(), .replace()

```python
print(name.upper())
# Output: ALICE
print(name.replace("A", "X"))
# Output: Xlice
```
